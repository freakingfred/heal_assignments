## General Notes
1. Always keep Alyssaabethh on critical tank healing assignments
2. Solvyn and Strezz should handle primary dispel duties when needed
3. Keep strong Chain Healers (Foldedmango, Skylinez) with melee groups
4. Adjust Ahintokos's responsibilities based on performance
5. Always maintain at least 2 healers per position for Shazzrah

## Updated General Notes
1. Alyssaabethh remains primary MT healer - consistently highest parsing healer
2. Skylinez and Foldedmango should focus on group healing where Chain Heal is most effective
3. Solvyn removed from some Shazzrah healing due to lower performance there
4. Adjusted Garr healing to account for Foldedmango's lower performance on that fight
5. Kept Strezz in flexible roles where their consistent performance is valuable
6. Positioned Deathisper and Dugrisarg in more supported roles
7. Maintained Ahintokos in HoT-focused assignments until performance data available
8. Added Shyamalan to more focused single-target healing assignments where they perform better
